Here is a list of all the projects I am working on or have worked on.

I have not included this website, but in case you are interested, this website uses Jekyll, Bootstrap, and Trianglify.js to function. It is hosted off of a [Github repository](). I chose this combination to greatly minimize the amount of dependency I need for services that require an account or a database. Fork if you like the design!
